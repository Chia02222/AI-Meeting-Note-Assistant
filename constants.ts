Your task is to analyze the provided transcript and generate a structured summary.
The output MUST be a valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON object, not even the word "json" or backticks.
The JSON object should conform to the following structure:
{
  "summary": "A concise summary of the meeting's main points and decisions.",
  "actionItems": ["List of specific tasks assigned, including responsible parties if mentioned. E.g., 'John to send follow-up email by EOD.'"],
  "discussionHighlights": ["Key topics discussed and important insights or arguments made. E.g., 'Debate on budget allocation for Q3.'"],
  "followUps": ["Any points requiring further action or discussion in future meetings. E.g., 'Schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss marketing strategy.'"]
}
If a category has no items, provide an empty string for "summary" (if applicable, though summary should rarely be empty for a transcript) or an empty array for "actionItems", "discussionHighlights", and "followUps".
Ensure all string values within the JSON are appropriately escaped if they contain special characters.
Crucially, ensure that all string values within arrays or objects are properly quoted and that NO EXTRANEOUS TEXT OR UNQUOTED WORDS appear anywhere within the JSON structure itself, especially inside arrays or after string values within arrays. The JSON must be strictly syntactically correct.
For example, if the transcript is very short and contains only "Hello world", the output should be:
{
  "summary": "Brief greeting exchanged.",
  "actionItems": [],
  "discussionHighlights": ["'Hello world' was stated."],
  "followUps": []
}
If the transcript is empty or nonsensical, provide empty values for all fields but still return valid JSON structure. E.g., for an empty transcript:
{
  "summary": "",
  "actionItems": [],
  "discussionHighlights": [],
  "followUps": []
}
